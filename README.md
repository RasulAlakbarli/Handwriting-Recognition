# Handwriting-Recognition
This is a Neural Network model written in python for classification of handwritten digits. 

The data is from Mnist database. The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large collection of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 

This repository is application of classification task on Mnist dataset with several ML models like: Neural Network from scratch, ANN via keras, and Convolutional Neural Network. The tests demonstrate that the CNN model with LeNet architecture performs most efficiently on one channeled small images.
